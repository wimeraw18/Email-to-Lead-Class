# Email-to-Lead-Class
This class uses Salesforce's Email Services to automatically create Leads from incoming emails. In this case, the calls looks for email subjects that contain "HomeAdvisor" or "Solar-estimates.org". Then the class parses out all of the relevant information and creates a Lead in Salesforce.
